hey everyone i'm going to add websockets in addition to the http api wrapper

i'm also going to do a nearly complete implementation of the http api wrapper,
e.g. uploading files for avatars

maybe it'll even be possible to send sound but i don't know, that's undocumented

hold on to ur butts because it might take a while :^)

if anything looks stupid let me know because you probably know more than me!

i'm not sure if i should be validating parameters sent to api or not.
i'm also not sure on the best way to do that

p.s. i might keep track of progress in this readme if i get enough time to do it

p.p.s. is it even worth testing the http api wrapper stuff

p.p.p.s im gonna upload this to hex when its done
